## *Overloading* Methods
*Method overloading* occurs when there are different *method signatures* with the same name but different type parameters. Everything other than the *method signatue* can vary for overloaded methods. This means there can be different *access modifiers*, *specifiers* (like **`static`**), return types and expression lists. 

## At compile time:
* a method whith a `return` type, say other than `void`, should <b>always</b> return a value
* unreachable code is not allowed
