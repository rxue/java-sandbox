## *Overloading* Methods
*Method overloading* occurs when there are different *method signatures* with the same name but different type parameters. Everything other than the *method signatue* can vary for overloaded methods.  *Optional specifiers* are not mentioned in the concept => *method overloading* can happen among `static` methods. Refer to: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2475259/can-i-override-and-overload-static-methods-in-java

## At compile time:
* a method whith a `return` type, say other than `void`, should <b>always</b> return a value
* unreachable code is not allowed
