## Concepts
* *Polymorphism*: the property of an object to take on different forms
## Object vs Reference
### Relevant rules:
* The type of the object    determines **which properties exist** within the object in memory
* The type of the reference determines **which members (methods and variables) are accessible** to the Java program
## *Virtual Methods*
