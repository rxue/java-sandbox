# Buzzwords
* *object*: an instance of a class
* Data types
  * *primitive type*: their values in the memory are where the *variable* is allocated
  * *reference type*: refers to an *object*. Their values are different from the **value of the object**, meaning *references* do not hold the value of the object. Instead, a reference "points" to an object by storing the memory address where the object is located (*reference* Resembles the *pointer* in C) 
* [*class members*](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/classvars.html)
* [*JavaBeans*](http://download.oracle.com/otndocs/jcp/7224-javabeans-1.01-fr-spec-oth-JSpec/): a *software component model* for Java
  * *Property*: instance variable
* [*constant expression*](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.28)
* [*numeric promotion*](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.6): a process by which, given an *arithmetic operator* and its argument expressions, the **arguments are converted to an inferred target type**.
  * *unary promotion*
  * *binary promotion*
# *Method Chaining*
Static methods cannot be chained. On the other hand, in *builder design pattern*, *parameters* are passed to a builder object often through *method chaining*
