 * Puzzler 2: Time for a Change
 *
 * Consider the following word problem:
 * Tom goes to the auto parts store to buy a spark plug that costs $1.10, but all he
 * has in his wallet are two-dollar bills. How much change should he get if he pays
 * for the spark plug with a two-dollar bill?
 *
 * If you ran the program, you found that it prints 0.8999999999999999
