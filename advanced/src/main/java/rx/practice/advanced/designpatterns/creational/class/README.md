## Factory Method aka. Virtual Constructor
As a creational pattern, the factory method handles the **object creation**, i.e.*encapsulation*, meaning object instances are initiated inside the factory method without letting outside world know the details of how and what. So **as a norm, every time the factory method is called, there should always be a new instance returned**, otherwise, it would not be a normal factory method pattern.
