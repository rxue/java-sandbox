# *I/O*
## *Steam* - the Lowest Level Abstraction of *I/O* in Java
Similar with *C*, the lowest level abstraction of *I/O* in Java is also *Stream*.

> [Input and output, whether to or from physical devices such as terminals and tape drives, or whether to or from files supported on structured storage devices, are mapped into logical data streams, whose properties are more uniform than their various inputs and outputs. Two forms of mapping are supported: text streams and binary streams.](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/Stream_IO#Streams)

* `ÃŒnputStream` is the *input stream* in Java 
* `OutputStream` is the *output stream* in Java
