## `Throwable` - *Exceptions*
The root *superclass* of all the *exceptions* is `Throwable`. To put it another way, all Java *Exceptions* are instances of `Throwable`, and thus this section is titled as `Throwable` - *exceptions*.

### Canonical Categorization of *Exceptions* Based on [*JLS*](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/)
The Java Language Specification, short for [*JLS*](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/), for Java SE 8 categorized *exceptions* into *unchecked exceptions* and *checked exceptions*:

> [The *unchecked exception classes* are the run-time exception classes and the error classes](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-11.html#jls-11.1)

> [The *checked exception classed* are all exception classes other than the *unchecked exception classes*. That is, the *checked exception classes* are `Throwable` and its subclasses other than `RuntimeException` and its subclasses and `Error` and its subclasses.](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-11.html#jls-11.1)
