# Concepts
* [*literals*](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html): It is possible to assign a *literal* to a variable of a primitive type. Values of the integral types `byte`, `short`, `int` and `long` can be created from `int` *literals*.

## [*Primitives* Date Types](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)
The sizes of the primitive types are *platform-independent*, meaning the sizes don't change from one machine architecture to another. In this sense *Java* is the very portable among most programming languages.

## Practical compiling rules of casting and autoboxing
**Implicit cast** and autoboxing/unboxing cannot happen successively. Refer to example erratic code [DemoCastingWithAutoboxing](#)
