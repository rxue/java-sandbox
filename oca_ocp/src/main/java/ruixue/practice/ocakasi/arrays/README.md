## *Array*
*Array* is a built-in data structure that contains other objects or primitives.
### *Array* as a *First-Class Object*
*Array* is *first-class object* in that:
* *Array* is an *Object*
	* can be initialized with `new` keyword
	* `Object.equals` is not overridden
	* `Object.toString` is not overriden

`int[] array = new int[10];` => `java.util.List array = new java.util.List[10];` is legal as well
