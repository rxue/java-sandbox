## *Generics*
### Generic Classes
When declaring a generic class, you must specify a name for the *formal type parameter* in angle bracket and, a *type parameter* can be named anything you want. The convention is to use single uppercase letters to make it obvious that they aren't real class names. For example, * by convention, `public class Crate<T> {}`
* legal but bad practice, `public class Crate<Object> {}`
