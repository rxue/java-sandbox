## `java.nio.file.Path`
The essence of `Path`:
* `Path` is an `interface` because
	* creating a file or directory is considered a file system-dependent task in NIO.2 
* Its implementations are *immutable*
* it is an "abstract" primary entry point for working with NIO.2 API
* most methods of `Path` interface but **not all** are sometimes called *syntactic operations* in that they operate on the `Path` itself but don't access to the *file system*
	* the *path* of `Path` object might not exist physically, invoking mehtods of `Path` can still work
	* the actual operations on *file system* can be executed with those *static methods* on *utility class* `java.nio.file.Files`
	* methods of `Path`, which is not *syntactic operation* - `public Path toRealPath(LinkOption... options) throws IOException`
* Unlike `java.io.File` class, `Path` contains support for *symbolic links*

## `java.nio.file.Files`
All the methods starting with `create` returns a `Path`
