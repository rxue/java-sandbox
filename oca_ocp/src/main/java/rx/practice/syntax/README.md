### *Blank final*<sup>Thinking in Java: Reusing Classes > The final keyword</sup>
Java allows the creation of *blank finals*, which are fields that are declared as `final` but are not given an initialization value.

> You're forced to perform assignments to `final`s either with an expression at the point of definition of the field or in every constructor. That way is guaranteed that the `final` field is always initialized.
